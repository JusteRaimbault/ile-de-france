## Synthetic population pipeline for ÃŽle-de-France
## based on the synpp package

# This is the path to a directory where the pipeline can store temporary data
working_directory: cache

# This section defines which parts of the pipeline should be run
run:
  #- synthesis.output # To create the output population in the output_path (see below)
  #- matsim.simulation.prepare
  #- matsim.simulation.debug
  #- matsim.runtime.eqasim
  - matsim.simulation.toll
  #- matsim.output # Uncomment, if you want to run the full simulation (you'll need Java for that)

# Here the configuraiton of the pipeline starts
config:
  # Some general configuration
  processes: 10
  osmosis_binary: osmosis
  maven_skip_tests: True

  # cordon toll - shapefile relative to the data path
  cordon_toll_price: 10000
  cordon_toll_shapefile: cordon/cordon.shp
  cordon_toll_name: test

  # eqasim
  eqasim_repository: https://github.com/JusteRaimbault/eqasim-java.git
  eqasim_branch: develop

  # Define whether to use ENTD or EGT as the household travel survey (HTS)
  hts: entd

  # Define sampling rate and random seed for the output population
  sampling_rate: 0.05
  random_seed: 42

  # Paths to the input data and where the output should be stored
  data_path: data
  output_path: output

  # Only interesting if you run the simulation
